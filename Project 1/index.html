          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>

            scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from
            2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram,
            Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
            spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
            administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
            and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
            military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile
